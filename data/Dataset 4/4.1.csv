"NCT00090545A Phase II Study of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) in Metastatic, Androgen-Independent Prostate CancerBAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) is an experimental cancer drug produced by Bayer Health Care Corporation. It represents a new class of anticancer agents known as bi-aryl ureas. This study will investigate its effect on prostate cancer and its side effects. Researchers expect to enroll a maximum of 46 men with prostate cancer for this study. The duration of the study will depend on its results.

Before beginning to take the drug, patients will be admitted to the hospital for 2 days, have a medical examination and give blood samples, and have a tumor or bone marrow biopsy. On the first day of the study, patients will begin taking the drug as 2 tablets twice daily, morning and evening. Blood will be taken throughout the day to determine the drug's level in the bloodstream.

Patients will be discharged from the hospital on the second day, and will continue to take the drug twice daily until instructed to stop. During each of the first 4 weeks, patients will be required to have their blood pressure checked. At the end of the first 4 weeks, patients will have a physical examination and blood tests, as well as a second tumor or bone marrow biopsy.

After the first 4 weeks, patients will continue with their drug regimen. At the end of each 4-week cycle, patients will have a physical examination and blood tests. Patients will also have x-Rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) at every other 4-week examination or as required.

"NCT00634647Satraplatin and Prednisone to Treat Prostate CancerBackground:

Satraplatin is an experimental drug that may be of benefit to patients with prostate cancer.

Prednisone is approved for treating prostate cancer.

The gene excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1) helps repair cell damage caused by satraplatin. It is possible that patients who have a variant of this gene will not benefit from treatment with satraplatin because the drug will not be able to damage the cancer cells effectively.

Objectives:

To determine if satraplatin may help treat prostate cancer in patients with certain variants of the ERCC1 gene.

Eligibility:

Patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer whose disease has not responded to hormonal therapy or at least one type of chemotherapy and whose x-rays, scans or other tests have shown their cancer to be spreading.

Design:

Participants have a blood test to determine if they have a variant of the ERCC1 gene.

Participants take satraplatin by mouth every day for 5 consecutive days out of every 35 days and prednisone by mouth every day. These 35-day treatment cycles may continue for 6 months or longer, depending on the benefits and side effects of the treatment.

During the treatment period, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Blood tests on days 1 of the treatment cycle.
* Weekly blood draws for the first 3 treatment cycles.
* Imaging studies (e.g., bone scans, computed tomography (CT) scans) every two cycles to determine the response to treatment.

"NCT01553188AMG 386 and Abiraterone for Advanced Prostate CancerBackground:

* Advanced prostate cancer is treated with surgery or drugs that lower the levels of androgens (male hormones) in the body. However, some cancers become resistant to this treatment. These types of cancers are known as castration-resistant prostate cancers.
* Interfering with the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors can slow prostate cancer growth. Trebananib (AMG 386), a new anticancer drug, targets the blood vessels that feed tumors. It has been tested for different types of cancer, but not for prostate cancer. Researchers want to see if AMG 386 can slow disease progression in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. AMG 386 will be given with abiraterone and prednisone, two drugs that are also used to treat advanced prostate cancer.

Progression of bone lesions by PCWG criteria was the appearance of ‚â•2 new bone lesions on bone scan, that have been confirmed to not represent tumor flare, and was persistent for ‚â•6 weeks. The rPFS was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. Participants without a rPFS event were censored at the date of last disease assessment., Up to approximately 28 monthsProstatic Neoplasms";TRUE
"NCT03834519Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Olaparib Versus Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) (MK-7339-010/KEYLYNK-010)The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of the polyadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib and pembrolizumab in the treatment of participants with mCRPC who have failed to respond to either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (but not both) and to chemotherapy.

The primary study hypotheses are that the combination of pembrolizumab plus olaparib is superior to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide with respect to:

1. Overall Survival (OS) and
2. Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)

As of Amendment 06, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is no longer applicable. Participants still on treatment may have the option to continue receiving study intervention or SOC if they are deriving clinical benefit, until criteria for discontinuation are met. Participants who are still on study treatment and deriving clinical benefit will no longer have tumor response assessments by BICR. However, local tumor imaging assessments should continue per SOC schedule. In addition, ePRO assessments will no longer be performed and biomarker samples will no longer be collected.BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: PrednisoloneOverall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves., Up to ~31 months|Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ‚â•20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ‚â•5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or ‚â•2 new bone lesions was also considered PD. PCWG-modified RECIST is similar to RECIST 1.1 with the exception that a confirmation assessment of PD (\>4 weeks after the initial PD) is required for participants who remain on treatment following a documented PD per RECIST 1.1 and PCWG rules include new bone lesions. The rPFS per PCWG-modified RECIST as assessed by BICR for all participants is presented. The nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves., Up to ~31 monthsProstatic Neoplasms";TRUE
