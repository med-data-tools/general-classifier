* Treatment with docetaxel (TAXOTERE¬Æ) every three weeks (q3w) plus leuprolide acetate (ELIGARD¬Æ) versus leuprolide acetate alone (ELIGARD¬Æ)
* Immediate treatment following prostatectomy versus deferred treatment at the time of relapse

Using a 2x2 factorial design participants will therefore be randomized to

* Immediate adjuvant treatment with docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy)
* Immediate adjuvant treatment with leuprolide acetate alone (hormonal therapy)
* Deferred treatment with docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy)
* Deferred treatment with leuprolide acetate alone (hormonal therapy)

Primary Objective:

* The primary objective of the study is to compare progression-free survival using a 2x2 factorial design

Secondary Objectives:

* To compare the 5-year overall, cancer-specific and metastasis-free survival after systemic treatment between the groups
* To compare the safety and tolerability between Docetaxel in combination with leuprolide acetate and leuprolide acetate alone.
* To evaluate quality of life as measured by the FACT-P questionnaire.

Originally, 1696 participants were planned in the study (with 424 participants randomized to each arm). However, only a total of 211 participants completed the randomization procedure as of 26 September 2007. Thus, sanofi-aventis, in accordance with the Steering Committee, decided to stop the participant recruitment as of 26 September 2007. Participants who had already signed their Informed Consent (IC) before September 26, 2007 were allowed to enter the randomization if they met eligibility criteria. The final revised number of planned participants to be randomly assigned to the 4 treatment arms was 250, and 228 participants were actually randomized.

The final sample size did not allow all the statistical analyses to be conducted on efficacy data. Therefore, the protocol was amended to reflect the change in the plans for statistical analysis. The study was underpowered to serve as the basis for drawing conclusions regarding efficacy and quality of life (QoL) endpoints.DRUG: Docetaxel (TAXOTERE¬Æ) Chemotherapy|DRUG: Leuprolide acetate ( ELIGARD¬Æ) Hormonal Therapy|DRUG: Docetaxel (TAXOTERE¬Æ) Chemotherapy|DRUG: Leuprolide acetate ( ELIGARD¬Æ) Hormonal Therapy|DRUG: Leuprolide acetate ( ELIGARD¬Æ) Hormonal TherapyProgression-free Survival (PFS) Assessment - Number of Participants With Disease Progression, PFS is the interval from the date of surgery to date of progression.

"NCT00528866Radiation Therapy, Androgen Suppression, and Docetaxel in Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer Who Have Undergone Radical ProstatectomyRATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high-dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as leuprolide, goserelin, flutamide, or bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with androgen suppression and docetaxel after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

"NCT00634647Satraplatin and Prednisone to Treat Prostate CancerBackground:

Satraplatin is an experimental drug that may be of benefit to patients with prostate cancer.

Prednisone is approved for treating prostate cancer.

The gene excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1) helps repair cell damage caused by satraplatin. It is possible that patients who have a variant of this gene will not benefit from treatment with satraplatin because the drug will not be able to damage the cancer cells effectively.

Objectives:

To determine if satraplatin may help treat prostate cancer in patients with certain variants of the ERCC1 gene.

Eligibility:

Patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer whose disease has not responded to hormonal therapy or at least one type of chemotherapy and whose x-rays, scans or other tests have shown their cancer to be spreading.

Design:

Participants have a blood test to determine if they have a variant of the ERCC1 gene.

Participants take satraplatin by mouth every day for 5 consecutive days out of every 35 days and prednisone by mouth every day. These 35-day treatment cycles may continue for 6 months or longer, depending on the benefits and side effects of the treatment.

During the treatment period, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Blood tests on days 1 of the treatment cycle.
* Weekly blood draws for the first 3 treatment cycles.
* Imaging studies (e.g., bone scans, computed tomography (CT) scans) every two cycles to determine the response to treatment.

"NCT01588821Cabozantinib in Advanced Solid MalignanciesThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not approved the drug for this type of cancer, or for any use outside of research studies.

When cancer spreads from the primary tumor, one of the most commons sites it spreads to is bone. When cancer spreads to bone there can be significant symptoms such as pain.

Cabozantinib works by blocking signaling that leads to cancer growth as well as blocking the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that help to feed a tumor. Cabozantinib has been studied or is being studied in research studies as a possible treatment for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, brain cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancer and kidney cancer.

"NCT01875250Enzalutamide in Combination With PSA-TRICOM in Patients With Non-Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate CancerBackground:

- Enzalutamide is a well tolerated hormone therapy that is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is given to help kill cancer cells and limit cancer cell growth. A new possible way of treating prostate cancer is using a therapeutic cancer vaccine (immune stimulating therapy) that may help activate the immune system against the cancer. The immune stimulating vaccine will help white blood cells recognize and kill the cancer cells throughout the body. This vaccine therapy has been tested in hundreds of patients and is very well tolerated. Researchers want to see whether this vaccine, given with enzalutamide, is more effective at treating advanced prostate cancer than enzalutamide alone.

Objectives:

- To compare the safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide with and without vaccine therapy for advanced prostate cancer.

Key Eligibility:

* Men at least 18 years of age who have advanced castration sensitive prostate cancer.
* Patients must have testosterone within the normal range
* No evidence of metastatic prostate cancer on computed tomography (CT) or Bone scan
* No history of autoimmune diseases
* No previous immunotherapy within 3 years

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to monitor the cancer before treatment.
* Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have enzalutamide and the study vaccine. The other group will have enzalutamide alone.
* All participants will take enzalutamide once a day. They will take the drug for 3 months. This form of intermittent therapy is common in this population of patients.
* The vaccine group of participants will receive the new study vaccine. They will have a single injection on the first day of the first study cycle. There will be regular booster injections afterward. There will be one injection during the third week of treatment, and one in the fifth week.

"NCT02649439Prostvac in Patients With Biochemically Recurrent Prostate CancerBackground:

Some people who have been treated for prostate cancer still have high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. This may indicate cancer. These people have non-metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) or biochemical recurrent prostate cancer. Researchers think the immune system can be taught to fight and kill cancer cells. They think an immunotherapy vaccine called prostvac could help reduce PSA levels in people with this type of prostate cancer.

Objective:

To test if prostvac can decrease tumor growth rate as measured by PSA compared to getting surveillance alone.

Eligibility:

Men ages 18 or older who have nmCSPC or biochemical recurrent prostate cancer

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Blood and urine tests

Bone scan

Computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

"NCT02649855Docetaxel and PROSTVAC for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate CancerBackground:

Metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the prostate area. It can be controlled by lowering the amount of testosterone in the body. This is called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The vaccine PROSTVAC might help the immune system kill cancer cells. Researchers want to add PROSTVAC and docetaxel chemotherapy to ADT. They think this may work better against prostate cancer than ADT alone.

Objective:

To test if adding PROSTVAC and docetaxel to ADT works better against prostate cancer than ADT alone.

Eligibility:

Men ages 18 years and over with metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Physical exam
